# u2g
U2G (User-to-Global) is a Python library for secure messaging through public servers. Each message is encrypted on the senderâ€™s side and can be sent to a server that broadcasts it to all connected users. Thanks to encryption, only the recipient can read the message content, ensuring privacy even over public channels.
